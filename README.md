This project demonstrates an IoT-enabled level crossing system using an Arduino Mega, SIM900 GSM module, LCD display, push button, and two servo motors to automate the control of the crossing barriers based on remote GSM communication.

**Components Used

Arduino Mega 2560: The main microcontroller board.
SIM900 GSM Module: For remote control via SMS or call.
LCD Display (16x2): To display system status.
Push Button: For manual control of the barriers.
2 Servo Motors: To simulate the opening and closing of the crossing barriers.

**Features

Remote control of the level crossing using SMS commands via the GSM module.
Manual override using a push button to open/close the barriers.
Real-time system status displayed on the LCD screen.
Fail-safe mechanisms to ensure proper barrier operation.
